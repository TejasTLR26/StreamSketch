The Live Webcam Sketching System is an interactive application that enables real-time virtual drawing using computer vision. By tracking a colored object via a webcam, it overlays sketches on the live feed, merging physical motion with digital artistry. Utilizing HSV-based color tracking, the system provides a creative and intuitive platform for digital visualization.
